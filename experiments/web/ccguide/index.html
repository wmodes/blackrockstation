      <p id="title">An Alternative Travel Guide to Catchouts, Crew Changes, Automated Refueling Stations, and Temporal Anomalies Throughout the Former United States and Canada</p>

      <p>This is the 2104 edition of the crew change with Big Cakes' Basic Guide published over a hundred years ago in 1993. We keep it in print as informed riders can use temporal anomalies to take advantage of rail travel from a variety of eras. It includes revisions and new info on yards and crew change points throughout the former US and Canada. Rail operations are constantly changing. We include as many updates as we can but there are still many locations we didn't get updates on from others and didn't have time to research on our own. Some info is sure to be applicable only within a particular temporal location -- especially specific train schedules/times, local bus routes, and landmarks. Treat info about anomolies with the greatest of care. We generally try to date <span class="year">(2036)</span> specific info so you can see how recent we received it.</p>

      <p>We would like to dedicate this edition to Libby &quot;21st C Bo&quot; Blochner, an enthusiastic train rider and overall great gal. who died at the beginning of 2103.</p>

      <h3>What to Worry About</h3>

      <p>Safety is a big deal on the railroad. It is real easy to get good and hurt. You are made of soft, breakable stuff, while railroad equipment is made of very hard, very heavy stuff. A rolling boxcar won't even flinch as it quietly rolls right over you in a sneaky surprise attack.</p>

      <p>Furthermore, accidents make everyone look bad. You, me, the railroad gal who told you what train to get on, all the people who saw you and were too cool to call the bull on you. This is why, everytime you talk to a rail, he or she will tell you to stay safe.</p>

      <p>Don't walk on the tracks. Don't cross under couplers or cars. And watch for cars rolling quietly through the yard. Be careful out there.</p>

      <p><u>Being wasted. or even somewhat drunk or high. while on or around trains increases your risk and the likelihood you will disregard the above rules and other safety practices around trains.</u></p>

      <p>Some yards have a railroad cop, or "bull." The bull typically sits is some office somewhere until someone calls him with a problem, which is seldom. Occasionally, the bull will make a foray out of the office to cruise around in a white pick-up or bronco, typically. In "hot" yards, the bull may proactively patrol the roads through the yard. To avoid the bull, stay out of sight of the roads within the yard. Walk between strings of cars. Watch for the bull-mobile. Watch for flashlights. Stay out of danger. Steer clear of the office. Many smart riders adopt a sort of "ghost protocol" where if they are never seen, not only d they avoid getting caught, but also avoid putting workers' jobs in danger.</p>

      <h3>What to Bring</h3>

      <p>Keep everything dark -- dark clothes, dark pack, dark sleeping bag or blanket. This will make it harder to get caught by the railroad cops as you blunder around the train yards.</p>

      <p>You'll be walking a lot and throwing your pack on and off of trains, so pack small and light -- under 25 pounds. If you have something in your pack that <i>can</i> break, it will. Leave your valuables at home.</p>

      <p>And think about warmth. Dress in layers. You may end up on an open car in the middle of the night with a 60 mile an hour wind blowing in your face. Your clothes and your sleeping bag should keep you warm and comfortable and dry. If you're cold and wet, freight-hopping will be a miserable experience.</p>

      <p>Bring some sturdy gloves and boots to keep you safe as you scramble around on freight cars. And if you prefer not to sunburn your ears and nose off, bring a hat.</p>

      <p>It's nice to know where you are. An atlas can come in handy, both for finding where to catch-out and for finding out where you've been left. You may be able to round up a railroad map. Obviously, if you have cell service satellite maps are invaluable.</p>

      <p>Bring something to drink. Exposure to the wind sucks the liquids right out of you. Bring something that's not going to spill when you throw your pack on and off of cars.</p>

      <p>Don't forget to bring your patience. Freight-hopping involves as much walking and waiting as actual riding. You spend most of your time waiting for information, waiting for a train, waiting for your train to get under way, waiting, waiting, waiting. For this you'll need flexibility and patience. Here's a quick checklist:</p>

      <ul class="two-col">
      	<li style="list-style-type:disc">dark clothes</li>
      	<li style="list-style-type:disc">dark pack under 25 lbs</li>
      	<li style="list-style-type:disc">sturdy gloves</li>
      	<li style="list-style-type:disc">sturdy boots</li>
      	<li style="list-style-type:disc">hat</li>
      	<li style="list-style-type:disc">railroad atlas or map</li>
      	<li style="list-style-type:disc">warm, waterproof jacket</li>
      	<li style="list-style-type:disc">light, warm bedding</li>
      	<li style="list-style-type:disc">water or other liquid</li>
      	<li style="list-style-type:disc">non-perishable food</li>
      	<li style="list-style-type:disc">patience and endurance</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Don't rely on networked electronics for obvious reasons.</p>

      <h3>Where to Catch-out</h3>

      <p>Find your local freight yard. There'll be a train leaving or coming through there eventually. Look for train yards in the forgotten part of town, the part of town with all the rough neighborhoods. The yard is usually near big industry, maybe near a river or port. You can often find givaway street names like Railroad Ave. The passenger train station is probably not too far away.</p>

      <p>There are freight yards in almost every city in America. However, there are fewer marshalling yards where they make up and break down trains. These big yards are going to be the easiest places to gather information and catch-out. Here you can ask the yard crew which trains are leaving where when.</p>

      <p>Some yards are crew change-points. A single crew can work a maximum number of hours, so yards at which trains receive fresh crews are strategically placed along the mainlines. These are good yards to catch out from.</p>

      <h3>How to get Information</h3>

      <p>Railroad workers are your friends and will help you out whenever possible. Crews can usually only tell you where their train is going and when power's called for. Yard workers often know the whole story. They make up all the trains that are leaving their yard. They know which trains are going where and often when the power is called for. They will sometimes call in to the tower to find out what track your train is on and when it leaves.</p>

      <h3>What to Ride</h3>

      <p>In order of preference, you want to ride in open boxcars, on the rear platform of a grainer or hopper, between the wheels of piggybacked trailers, in the well behind cargo containers, on the second or third deck of empty auto carriers, or in empty gondolas. And when you get really bold, you can ride on the back engine of several coupled units at night.</p>

      <p>Your safety is the most important consideration. Don't take short cuts to save time. Tank cars carry all sorts of nasty shit and provide no good place to ride; don't ride 'em. Loaded flatcars and loaded gondolas provide you the opportunity to be crushed or pushed off a car by a shifting load; don't ride 'em. Cars marked Bad Order are broken but are frequently not removed from service; don't ride 'em.</p>

      <p><strong>Disclaimer: This guide is not intended to encourage people to hop trains or trespass and is for informational purposes only. For people who are riding trains anyway, having accurate information helps to increase overall safety and to decrease the chance of accidents or any possible interference with RR operations. This in turn helps decrease any possible risk or burden to RR companies from having riders on the property.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Another warning! A lot of effort, by many people over a hundred years now, has gone into putting this guide together. It is intended as detailed info for people who already know how to ride, so please do not publish or post on the Lib any of this info. This guide should only ever be given away and the vast majority of our community prefers that it be kept 'low profile' and never be put on public display or sale. We know this is hard to accept for many people in the online era ... but not every damn thing in the world needs to be on the Lib! Please be careful and discreet with your copy of the guide and only give copies to riders who you know will be responsible with it.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>Final warning! The anomolies listed here are sometimes based on the thinnest of rumor. For obvious reasons, locals often deliberately try to keep them on the D.L. or obfuscate their locations with counter-rumor. Therefore, use this info at your own risk. Be aware that these locations often travel unpredictably (sometimes on long intervals) and returning to your own temporal position can be difficult or impossible. Always travel (and pack appropriately) with the expectation that you may not return home.</strong></p>
